# University-Rankings
Creating my own metrics for University Rankings. The University Ranking Websites have too much Lobbying. 

The Metric is as follows:
1) The higher the citations the better the research, so I will include that in my metric. 
2) The more students the less personalized the education is. I would rather learn online then go to a 2000 person lecture, so the number of students will also be in the metric. 
3) Obviously the overall ranking of the university is important and is indicated by 'i' in the equation

The new metric is a follows:

      data["size_quality_rank"][i] = (10000000*citations) / ((num_students*1000)*(i+1))





Oh, I guess my own University ranks number one in Canada. hmmm. Maybe Statistics can be biased after all.
